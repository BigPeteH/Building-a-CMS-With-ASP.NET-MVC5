### Tuts+ Course: Build a CMS With ASP.NET MVC5
**Instructor: Jeremy McPeak**

The best way to understand a language or platform is to build something with it, and that's exactly what we'll do in this course. You'll write a simple CMS using C# and ASP.NET MVC5, and you'll learn a lot in the process. 
We'll cover some of the features of ASP.NET MVC 5 including attribute routing, areas and custom model binding. We'll practice project organization and testing and also explore ASP.NET Identity.
